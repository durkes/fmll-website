		<p>As an original, long-time owner in the Deer Run Homeowner neighborhood I have been very impressed with the lawn and landscape management provided us by First Management!  Never have I had the need to worry about grass being blown on to, and left on, our patios, driveways, and side walks!  Seldom do I have to ask for lower limbs on our more mature trees be trimmed or our shrubs growing out of control--but if I do ask, the issue has always been corrected immediately!  Never have I needed to telephone to ask for snow &amp; ice be removed from our streets and sidewalks in a timely manner = First Management always takes care of it!</p>
