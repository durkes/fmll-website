						<h3 class="box-header">About the Emerald Ash Borer</h3>
						<p class="description t1">The Emerald Ash Borer is a beetle native to eastern Asia, where it is not considered a significant pest since it is typically found only in low densities. In North America, however, it is an invasive species which feeds on and destroys ash trees (the U.S. contains up to 21 species of ash). Local governments are concerned about the destruction of ash trees, and are actively working to educate the public about the threat and reduce the destruction.</p>

						<h4 class="box-header margin-t5">The Threat</h4>
						<p class="description t1">The beetles deposit eggs between bark crevices, flakes, or cracks. After hatching, the larvae chew through the bark where they feed and develop. This process harms the trees, eventually causing them to die. <strong>All ash trees are expected to die in an infested area within 10 years if preventative measures are not taken.</strong> Kansans and Midwesterners in general are currently battling this harmful creature.</p>
